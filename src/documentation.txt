Portfolio page:
    There are 3 buttons:
        1. Add a new project - shows the "add new project dialogue"
        2. Edit - reveals the hidden projects and also allows the user to set the visibility to true/false for each project using the checkbox in the right side of the card. After exiting the edit mode, the user will see only the visible items.
        3. Delete - toggles the delete mode. In the delete mode if the user clicks on a project card, that one will be deleted

        By default, by clicking on a card, the router will navigate to that project's page
